# AI-Powered Communication Tools

An implementation of AI-powered communication tools using Google's Gemini model for email automation and chatbot functionality.

## Overview

This project implements the first two weeks of development for an AI-powered communication system that enhances business communication through automation. The system uses natural language processing (NLP) and Google's Gemini model to improve efficiency, reduce manual work, and ensure professional communication.

## Features

### Week 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Data processing pipeline for email, chatbot, and business report data
- Text preprocessing with tokenization and entity recognition
- NLP utilities for sentiment analysis and entity extraction
- Gemini API integration for AI-powered text generation

### Week 2: AI Model Development
- Email automation with smart categorization and reply generation
- Chatbot functionality with intent detection and response generation
- Business inquiry handling with context-aware responses
- Batch processing capabilities for emails and chat conversations
